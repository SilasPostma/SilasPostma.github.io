                RowPredict is an advanced machine learning tool designed to help rowing athletes and coaches predict performance times based on various training parameters.
            </p>
            <h3>How it Works</h3>
            <p>
                Our prediction model uses Random Forest technology trained on extensive rowing data to provide accurate performance predictions. By analyzing factors such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gender and weight class</li>
                <li>Experience level</li>
                <li>Training type and intensity</li>
                <li>Interval specifications</li>
                <li>Stroke rates (SPM)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The model can predict expected performance times, helping coaches and athletes optimize their training programs.
